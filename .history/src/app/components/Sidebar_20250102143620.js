Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Full-Stack Intern position. As a dedicated Information Science student with hands-on experience in full-stack development, I’ve worked independently on projects using Django for back-end development and frameworks like React and Next.js for front-end design.

My passion for programming drives me to create functional and impactful applications. Alongside my technical skills, I have experience managing projects and collaborating with teams to deliver results efficiently. I’m eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team while further developing my career in full-stack development.

This position aligns perfectly with my aspirations to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful projects. Thank you for considering my application—I’d love the opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your team.

Sincerely,
